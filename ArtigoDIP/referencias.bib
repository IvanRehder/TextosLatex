            Design innovation projects often generate large numbers of design ideas from designers, users, and, increasingly, the crowd over the Internet. Such idea data are often used for selection and implementation but, in fact, can 1also be used as sources of inspiration for further idea generation. In particular, the elementary concepts that underlie the original ideas can be recombined to generate new ideas. But it is not a trivial task to retrieve concepts from raw lists of ideas and data sources in a manner that can stimulate or generate new ideas. A significant difficulty lies in the fact that idea data are often expressed in unstructured natural languages. This paper develops a methodology that uses natural language processing to extract key words as elementary concepts embedded in massive idea descriptions and represents the elementary concept space in a core–periphery structure to direct the recombination of elementary concepts into new ideas. We apply the methodology to mine and represent the concept space underlying massive crowdsourced ideas and use it to generate new ideas for future transportation system designs in a real public sector-sponsored project via humans and automated computer programs. Our analysis of the human and computer recombination processes and outcomes sheds light on future research directions for artificial intelligence in design ideation.},

In particular, automated engineering enabled by artificial intelligence algorithms is used for pattern recognition and other highly complex tasks across physical, virtual and social media. Together, multiple do-it-yourself trends driven by human imagination combined with automated engineering bring mass imagineering. It has been claimed that this new potential for individuals to create what they imagine will bring revolutionary disruption to existing paradigms for production and consumption, which will benefit individuals greatly. Conversely, others have claimed that whatever change occurs will advance organizations within existing paradigms at the expense of individuals. In this article, it is explained that mass imagineering has limited potential to bring revolutionary disruption to mass production and mass customization. Rather, it can facilitate their enrichment for the benefit of both organizations and individuals by better enabling complementary cultures for creativity, choice and convenience.},

Cultural creativity has broken the rigid design and production mode of traditional products from the perspective of market and has become the key to improve the economic benefits and competitiveness of traditional products. From the perspective of cultural and creative product design and product development, artificial intelligence technology has been fully utilized at the present stage. The purpose of this article is to compare the traditional design patterns used in product design and understand the new design patterns assisted by artificial intelligence so as to achieve the purpose of process simplification and design innovation more quickly. In this article, traditional graphic patterns and local cultural connotations of the experimental area are taken as the main research points. Through a large number of field investigations and first-hand photo materials, the regional cultural characteristics and local traditional graphic language are analyzed in detail and then summarized. Finally, the examples of development research are summarized and reflected. It is hoped that through the further excavation of the traditional patterns of the region and the exploration of the level of regional culture regeneration, the development of local economy, culture, and tourism can be driven, and a cultural brand that can go out of Anhui province and into the whole country can be built. At the present stage of product research and development, the key is to introduce artificial intelligence means as necessary support and try to infiltrate artificial intelligence measures in the research and development of new products in each link.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Creativity is an important skill for design teams to reach new and useful solutions. Designers often use one or more of creativity and innovation techniques (CITs) to achieve the desired creative potential during new product development (NPD). The selection of adequate CITs requires considerable expertise, given the multiple application contexts and the extensive number of techniques available. The purpose of this study is to present a creativity support system able to manage this amount of information and provide valuable knowledge to improve NPD.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study presents a knowledge-based system prototype using artificial intelligence (AI) to support knowledge management on the selection of CITs for design. CITs assertion is modelled through a double inference process using five categories, correlating over 500 different entry scenarios to 24 implemented CITs. The techniques are classified according to: design stage, innovation focus, team relationship, execution method and difficult of use. Prototype outputs explanations on the inference process and chosen techniques information.
            
            
              Findings
              To demonstrate the system scope, two opposite design cases are presented. The system was validated by experts in knowledge management and mechanical engineering design. The validation process demonstrates relevance of the approach and improvement directions for future developments.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Though literature contains toolkits and taxonomy for CITs, no work applies AI to identify design scenarios, select best CITs and instruct about their use. Validators reported to know less than half of the available techniques, showing a clear knowledge gap among design experts.},

	abstract = {While the design practice in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry continues to be a creative activity, approaching the design problem from a perspective of the decision-making science has remarkable potentials that manifest in the delivery of high-performing sustainable structures. These possible gains can be attributed to the myriad of decision-making tools and technologies that can be implemented to assist design efforts, such as artificial intelligence (AI) that combines computational power and data wisdom. Such combination comes to extreme importance amid the mounting pressure on the AEC industry players to deliver economic, environmentally friendly, and socially considerate structures. Despite the promising potentials, the utilization of AI, particularly reinforced learning (RL), to support multidisciplinary design endeavours in the AEC industry is still in its infancy. Thus, the present research discusses developing and applying a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model, an RL application, to assist the preliminary multidisciplinary design efforts in the AEC industry. The experimental work shows that MDP models can expedite identifying viable design alternatives within the solutions space in multidisciplinary design while maximizing the likelihood of finding the optimal design.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            A picture is worth a thousand words, and in design metric estimation, a word may be worth a thousand features. Pictures are awarded this worth because they can encode a plethora of information. When evaluating designs, we aim to capture a range of information as well, including usefulness, uniqueness, and novelty of a design. The subjective nature of these concepts makes their evaluation difficult. Still, many attempts have been made and metrics developed to do so, because design evaluation is integral to the creation of novel solutions. The most common metrics used are the consensual assessment technique (CAT) and the Shah, Vargas-Hernandez, and Smith (SVS) method. While CAT is accurate and often regarded as the “gold standard,” it relies on using expert ratings, making CAT expensive and time-consuming. Comparatively, SVS is less resource-demanding, but often criticized as lacking sensitivity and accuracy. We utilize the complementary strengths of both methods through machine learning. This study investigates the possibility of using machine learning to predict expert creativity assessments from more accessible nonexpert survey results. The SVS method results in a text-rich dataset about a design. We utilize these textual design representations and the deep semantic relationships that words and sentences encode to predict more desirable design metrics, including CAT metrics. We demonstrate the ability of machine learning models to predict design metrics from the design itself and SVS survey information. We show that incorporating natural language processing (NLP) improves prediction results across design metrics, and that clear distinctions in the predictability of certain metrics exist.
